# AirBnB Clone - Web Static

## Overview

Welcome to the AirBnB Clone - Web Static project! This is an exciting venture into the world of front-end development using HTML and CSS. Our goal is to create static pages, establish a style guide, and add some life to our AirBnB objects without diving into JavaScript.

Throughout this project, we'll delve into the following key concepts:

- HTML/CSS: The dynamic duo of front-end development.
- Understanding the Document Object Model (DOM).
- Styling web pages without the magic of JavaScript.
- W3C compliance and validation.
